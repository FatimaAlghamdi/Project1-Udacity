# Feed Reader Testing - Udacity Project

The goal of this project is writing test suite for application that reads RSS feeds by using
Jasmine testing framework.

## Getting Started (To run)

#### In order to run the app, follow the following steps:

1- Download the .zip file.

2- Extract the .zip file.

3- Open the index.html file in your browser.

## Test Suites

### (1) RSS Feeds:

- allFeeds variable has been defined and that it is not empty.

- Each feed object has a URL that is defined and not empty.

- Each feed object has a name that is defined and not empty.

### (2) The Menu:

- Ensure that the menu element is hidden by default when loading the page.

- The visibility of the menu is controlled by the menu icon.

### (3) Initial Entries:

- Ensure that there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container.

### (3) New Feed Selection:

- Ensure that the content actually changes when the loadFeed function loads a new feed
