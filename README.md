# Neighborhood Map - Udacity Project

The goal of this project is developing a single-page application featuring a map of any neighborhood, adding additional 
functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or any places, a search function
to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. Each location will have an
information window that contains a related information about it by using third-party APIs.
